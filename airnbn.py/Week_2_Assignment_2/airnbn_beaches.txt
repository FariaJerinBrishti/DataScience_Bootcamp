the owner is very helpful and prompt, the location is great if you want to check out Danga bay area, with beletine mall next door and quite a few eateries that are within reach. Enough said, the interior is pretty wear out, need to improve, the balcony chair need overhaul and hygiene need improvement.

In reality, entire apartment is not equate to pictures provided.

It’s rundown and not well maintained. The apartment seems vacant for years with broken chair, damaged and dirty amenities.

We are traumatised and felt extremely uncomfortable that we didn’t dare to even stay in the apartment for long and start in search for hotels as we have a kid.

Location is #1! This lovely apartment is just right around the corner of Jonker Street. Very convenient for food/walks. The common area had very chill / cafe vibes and was perfect for our group to chill after dinner.

If you’re driving, you can park across the street at the int’l school which is literally 1 minute walk from the front door and will cost you MYR40 for overnight parking.

The wifi signal unfortunately was a little weak unfortunately, but that was the least of our worries during our stay.

We loved the villa. It’s the best to chill where everything you need is there - with private beach, beachfront villa, pool and poolside bar with delicious western food, snooker, gym, 10 mins walk Turi beach and water sports. And villa got all the amenities you need.
It’s third time we went to Batam and staying at Amelia villa is the best experience ever.
A little bit far from city Center but taxi fare in Batam is a lot cheaper than Singapore, so it’s worth staying there. But suggesting to buy breakfast from outside whenever you go out, coz from Grab the breakfast is very expensive and cost us SDG120 for 5 people.
Needless to say, hosts are very friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back to the villa again 🥰

What an amazing place. So tranquil and scenic. Right across from the beach, we could all hear the sound of the waves crashing onto the shore at night. The Villa is beautifully decorated in classic Indonesian style with wonderful paintings and ornaments. There was full amenities (plenty of towels and pillows for us all), and travel to/from carpark assisted with a golf buggy by the wonderful Tuti.
There was also Tiger Bar located a few villas down with a fantastic swimming pool our kids spent most of their time in. A big thanks to Eddie and the crew there for wonderful selection of western food (The UFO burger is awesome!).
All the people at Nongsa are amazing, we had a great new years eve! Only complaint is my boss needs to give me more time off next time! 😄😁

Wifi is also very fast and stable. The only bad experience we had was when there was no water supply for about a week in total due to maintenance work. But Ivy was kind enough to give us some compensation to make up for this type of situation. Overall, we had a good stay here.

The villa is situated on a spacious lawn within a lush garden. You hear and watch butterflies and birds flying by and have a glimpse of the Singapore Straight from the patio. The kingfisher is a common sight and usually sits outside on a tree in the early morning.

The villa has a huge, modern, and fully equipped kitchen, making it easy to bake, cook and grill!

Relax!


Our 2 adjacent villas a great for large families and groups of up to 12 adults and 4 children. Check out the other villa here: https://www.airbnb.com/h/santaidua

Only 5 mins from Nongsa Ferry Terminal and part of Nongsa Resorts, this is the perfect COVID destress retreat.

Nongsa Village is an exclusive, members only resort.
There is a large, freshly renovated lagoon swimming pool with a shallow and deep section and a slide for kids. As well as two wading pool, ideal for younger children.

The beach is clean and the water nice to swim in at high tides and to enjoy a walk at low tides.

Take a walk on the private jetty and enjoy the sunrise over Eastern Indonesia and the sunset over Singapore. A marvelous experience indeed.
The jetty is also excellent for fishing - maybe you catch a nice fish or squid with a bit of luck., What this place offers

Amazing place for a secluded getaway from the city. Oliver's place is well equipped and spacious. I recommend getting a buggy and explore all resorts nearby.

The place is same as shown in pics ( nice location) ;however, Mr.Oliver not answering messages directly( waiting long hours for replies). I switched the house due to fridge not working. The house that I switched to had dirty towels thay I ended up cleaning it and didnt recieve the keys for the main door.

Oliver was a great host! Super friendly and response time was quick as well!

We had a really great time in the villa. It was cozy and had everything we needed. The villa was also in a gated compound with guards that were active 24/7 so this made us feel really safe. The entire compound was beautiful and so close to Turi Beach.

It’s an amazing place!

The chalet is located in wonderfull surroundings - calm and wild at the same time.The time spent there was deeply relaxing. Abbas is the nicest of hosts and superb cook.

A hidden gem. Got the entire beach to ourselves away from the hustle and bustle of the crowd. If you are a city ape that needs wifi and AC to survive then this is obviously not the place for you.
We needed a quiet place to recharge and got exactly that. Will definitely be back to try out the activities.

Pros:
- Quiet retreat
- Our host is an exceptional cook
- Very responsive and friendly host
- Chalet was very clean
- Sunset view from the rocks

Cons:
- Needs an additional boat ride from Genting to Nipah, but the host was super efficient and clear.
- Beach can be dark at night but we didn't need to go out since the chalet and hall were just next to each other. Would have been nice to view the beach at night. But the clear sky and stars made up for it.

Nipah is just the perfect place to disconnect and get closer to nature.
Abbas is a wonderful, joyful guest who will make your experience really unique.
Forget about the internet and choose from a large range of activities : jungle tour to the waterfalls, fishing, snorckeling, UNO "Nipah" rules ... are just a few of the options you'll get there. On top of that Abbas is a great chef and will adapt to your diet requirements. Not to mention the fact that the beach will be only yours. A truly unforgettable moment !

One of the best location in Tioman. Very peaceful and away from crowds. I'm the only one there throughout the stay and its so beautiful and its the real meaning of paradise. Abas is really great in hospitality and his cooked food is really delicious and amazing.
Hopefully will return again to this place. You will be welcome by the host pet "Eva", very friendly dog and cats.

Our stay at Nipah was truly the best experience we had during our trip in Malaysia. Ever smiling Abbas and his team made us feel so welcome and at home. The cooking of Tan was superb, the atmosphere fantastic and the beach and the surrounding nature overwhelmingly beautiful.
Nipah is the ultimate place to come to rest. To become creative, to reflect on what is important and to reconnect with your heart.
Slow down, be still and be touched. Giving ourself the Nipah experience was the best present ever. With love, Tjacco and Nanette

Heaven on earth! Words or photos can’t do the justice at all. I know we made the right choice by the second as we step off the boat.

No tourist, no car, no hard core party, just the sound of the waves.
No fancy food, but lovely cook by Abbas, better than 5 stars hotel.

There are many activities like fishing, snorkeling, kayaking offered but we chose to stay in and just look at the sea and connect with each other.

Abbas and Fendi are really kind and friendly. As a local we are extremely really proud to see Abbas, this young Malaysian who handle this place. And knowing his journey living in the island has inspired us in so many ways! So grateful to find this place. we will come back for sure! Highly recommended!

This place is a little bit of paradise ♥️
If you’re looking for a peaceful retreat to do very little but take in the stunning views of one of the most beautiful beaches I’ve ever been to... then you should stay here!
Me & my boyfriend stayed for 5 nights in the 3 person chalet with air con.
+ beach is beautiful & you walk right out on to it, listening to waves from your bed.
+ bed was comfy & room was clean.
+ hot shower inside bathroom & cold shower outside of chalet.
+ air con was good.
+ restaurants in walking distance either side of the chalets.
+ private and secure feel to the chalets , hidden between palm trees despite being right on the beach front.
+ hammocks and sun loungers to chill in were a nice touch.
-only negative would be the smell from the bathroom but we kept the door shut & you are so chilled you just get on with it.

The only word that can describe Piugus resort is Paradise. We loved our overwater cottage from which each morning before breakfast we could jump into the sea. Everything is perfectly mantained and spotlessly clean. In the roomrate was included all food, drinks and snacks. Chef Murni prepares great dishes with local products: fried squids, squids with vegetables, fish curry, fish fritters, soups and noodles. Breakfast is abundant: a selection of indonesian dishes, fried noodles or rice, toasts and eggs as you like. Each day we had boat excursions with our guide Aal and the Captain to explore the marvellous surroundings: Penjaling, Penyalin, Busung, Mengkilis, Temawan, Noran, Langok. The trips with the small boat cost about 400.000 rupiahs. In the afternoon, back from the excursions, the staff brought to our cottage delicious snacks as pisang goreng or banana pancakes and fresh coconuts. The reef around Piugus island is only partially alive, but we saw a lot of colorful fishes. But above all, we loved the warm welcoming we received at Piugus and the way the sentire staff took care of us, ready to satisfy our needs always with a smile. Thank you Herry, Aal, Captain, Murni, Sisnita and Lisa!
